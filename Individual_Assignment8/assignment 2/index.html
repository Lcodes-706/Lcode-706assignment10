        About: This webpage was created for the lesson 3 individual activity. I used my knowledge from the lessons to create a webpage that is selling my book collection for tuition funds. The collection has a wide range of genres which any can enjoy. I followed the exact instructions to form the webpage as well as using my creativity.
