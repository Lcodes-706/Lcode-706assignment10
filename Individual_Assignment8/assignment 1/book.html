        About:This webpage was created for the lesson 2 Practice Activity. I used my knowledge from the lessons to create a webpage that is selling my book collection for tuition funds. The collection has a wide range of genere's which any can enjoy. I followed the exact instructions to form the webpage, that si more informational, rather than interactive.
